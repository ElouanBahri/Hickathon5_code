# Hi! Paris 2025 Hackathon  

The [Hi! Paris Hackathon 2025](https://www.hi-paris.fr/) was an exciting challenge aimed at advancing artificial intelligence and data science. It was organized by **Hi! Paris**, a pioneering research center jointly established by **Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IP Paris)** and **HEC Paris**. Hi! Paris focuses on driving innovation in data analytics, AI, and the ethical development of technology, fostering collaboration between academia and industry.  

## Objective  
The goal of the hackathon was to predict water level categories in underground aquifers across France, classified into five levels. Participants were provided with a dataset containing **136 features** and approximately **3 million rows** to create their predictive models.  

## Results  
The evaluation metric was the **F1 score**, which balances precision and recall, computed on the test set provided by the organizers. Our final score was: **0.3735 F1_score on X_test**.  

This hackathon offered an excellent opportunity to apply advanced machine learning techniques to tackle a real-world environmental challenge.
